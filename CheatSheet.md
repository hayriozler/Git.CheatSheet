# Git basic architecture

## Able to better understanding of git; we should know some key terminologies

- **Repository**
  - A git repository is a collection of files that we have in the projects where to store under the .git folder
- **Commit**
  - When you commit your changes you are taking a snapshot of your project and store permenantly in your repository.
- **Staging(Index)**
  - The git kept monitoring all changes we have done in the staging area. To keeping files in your staging area will give a chance to review your changes before saving(commit) to your repository.
- **Please don't forget**; The git does not store deltas or what was changed. The git store all the content in a very efficient way. Storing all projects will give us the option to restore very quickly at any previous time the projects.
