# Git basic architecture

## Able to better understand git; we should know some key terminologies

- **Repository**
  - A git repository is a collection of files that we have in the projects where to store under the .git folder
- **Working Directory**
  - Wd is a folder where your documents and .git folder located
- **Commit**
  - When you commit your changes you are taking a snapshot of your project and store it permanently in your repository.
- **Staging(Index)**
  - The git kept monitoring all changes we have done in the staging area. Keeping files in your staging area will give you a chance to review your changes before saving(committing) to your repository.
- **Please don't forget**; The git does not store deltas or what was changed. The git store all the content in a very efficient way. Storing all projects will give us the option to restore them very quickly at any previous time the projects.

## Let's get started with git basic commands

|Command| Example  |  Description |
|:---|:---|:---|
|config | git config --global user.name "username" | You need to configure your username and email. The configuration can be done globally or only for specific reporsitory|
|config | - git config --global user.email "youremail@yourdomain.com" ||
|init   | git init  | Initalize a new git repository in the current folder. It creates a .git folder which is hidden by default. **Please do not touch or change manually in this folder.** |
| Add files to the repository  | git add file1.txt file2.txt or git add .  | You can specify the file name(s) or just "." that you want to add in the staging area. If you use the git add. it will recursively add all files in the repository, but you may not want to add all files in your repository therefore you need to create a special file to ignore them. **Git is not automatically tracked the file added to the directory. You should explicitly tell the git to keep track of them** |
| Status  | git status  | Show the current repository status  |
| Log  |  git log or git log --grep="Keyword" or git log -n 5 |  Show logs in the current branch|
| Commit  | git commit -m "message"  | The current snapshot will be written permanently in the repository. **Commit message is also important for a later stage to understand what is changed.**|
| Differences |  git diff "old commit Id" "new commit Id" | You can see the differences between commits. |
| Show  | git show "commit Id"  | Shows us all changes that were made in this commit. |
| Branch  | git branch  | Shows a list of branches in the repository  |
| Branch  | git branch -r | Shows a list of branches from remote stream **if you have remote repository.**|
| - New   |  git branch "branch_name" | Creates a new branch named "branch_name" |
| - Checkout | git branch -b  "branch_name"  | Swichtes between your branches  |
|  - Delete | git branch -d "branch_name"    | Delete branche.  |
| Reset  | git reset  | Reset means that; moves HEAD pointer to specified state. There are many types of reset in the git but I want to give you an information about only 3 of them.|
|  - Soft | git reset --soft commit_id  | Does not change anything in the the staging area or working tree, it will only change to to be commit stage. |
|  - Hard | git reset --hard  commit_id | Resets to staging area but not your working directory  |
|  - Mixed | git reset --mixed  commit_id |  Resets to staging area and working directory |
| Stash  | git stash  | When you want to temporarily save the current state of the working directory and staging area. |
| - List  | git stash list  | List of stash entries that you currently have.  |
| - Show  | git stash show  |  Show the changes recorded in the stash. |
| - Delete  | git stash drop "stash" | Delete the stash  |
| Rebase  |   |  Rebase is the process of combining a sequence of commits to the new base commits. Rebase helps us to keep clean history of repository. Rebase is usefull when you use feature branching workflow. |
| Tags  | git tag "tagname"  | Tags are references that specific point in the git history. That can be usefull when you have a new release. |
|  - List  | git tag  | it lists all tags you have in the repository |
|  - Checkout  | git checkout  | checkout the tags. This puts the repository in the deatached HEAD state.  |
|  - Push  | git push origin "tagname" | it pushes to a tag has been created previously in the repository  |
|  - Delete | git tag -d "tagname"  | it deletes the tag from the current repository.  |
